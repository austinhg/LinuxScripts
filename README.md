# LinuxScripts

A set of scripts I either made or added to for work.

### mediaportCleanup.sh

A script to clean out old media files on a Linux client machine. 
There was a problem with customers having the /home directory fill up due to video caching, this was my solution.

### periodicReboot.sh

A script to reboot our client devices nightly (at the business owners request) to prevent machine freeze-ups.

### fourthSundayRefresh.sh

Refreshes a database on the 4th Sunday of every month. More or less kept for the logic of running on a specific (n)th date of a month.
